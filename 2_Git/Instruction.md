Questions
========

### Q1
Suppose you merged some codes from another branch and merge conflicts occured. Then you want to give up merging and get back to the latest commit, what can you do? List the commands you need in the correct order.

### Q2
Let's say you need to use codes from another person’s forked repo,
”git@abc:anotherPerson:forked_repo.git” which is not in your remote list. What would you do if you want to compare the branch “feature_1” of that person's forked repo with your current branch? List the commands you need in the correct order.

### Q3
Suppose you want to checkout to another branch, but you have some incomplete work in your working directory, and you don’t want to make a new commit to commit those. Then how would you save your work temporary before checkout? (If you have some uncommited work in your current local branch, git will not allow you to checkout other branchs).  

### Q4
If you want to go back three commits which have been pushed, what is/are the commands to achieve that? (Go back one commit means go to the latest commit which has been pushed, so go back three commits means go to the third latest commit that was pushed to remote).
